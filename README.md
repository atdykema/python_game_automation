# Python scripts for game automation

Oldschool Runescape, the online MMORPG for which these scripts were written for, is a game based very much on spending large amounts of time grinding experience points in order to level up your character. Some of the ways in which experience is gained can be done without much attention, making parts of the game very boring and tiresome. Having found myself playing this game several months ago, I thought it might be a fun challange to build a script whichs perform actions in the game without myself being at my computer.

Using Python and the PyAutoGUI library, I was able to create a script which can detect the availibility of minerals in my characters viscinity based on pixel coloration and to act accordingly. I also incorperated randomized timings for my script actions to avoid penalties from anti-botting software built into the game. Additionally, I programmed a system into my script which can detect if my character was logged out due to the game's six hour log-out timer and to act accordingly, effectively allowing my character to gain experience for an infinite amount of time.
